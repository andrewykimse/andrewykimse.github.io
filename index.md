## Hi there, I'm Andrew

![a_drew_portrait.png](pictures/portrait.png)

I'm a software engineer who writes about the latest in computer vision technologies that interest me. When I'm not doing that though you'll find me obsessing over my collection of keyboards or dialing in my latest bag of specialty coffee.

Here you can find a little bit of everything about me; the technical with a splash of weird obsessions.
